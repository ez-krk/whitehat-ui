## bug bounty protocol : but anonymous, faster and fair.

bug bounty protocols often requires researchers to disclose their identity, the process is very bureaucratic and time-consuming for both parties involved, which causes harm for both parties, and often discourage whitehat hackers from getting their hands dirty.

we're here to change this and provide protocols and whitehat hackers :

- anonymity : confidential transfers
- faster : hackers submits a vulnerability, protocol validates it's legitimacy, hacker proceeds to hack, once validated
- fair : protocols set the percentage they're willing to pay

## anonymity

how do we provide anonymity ?

1. encrypted vulnerability reports (ed25519 ecies)
2. throwaway keys
3. confidential transfers (not implemented yet)

## faster process

You can combine Firebase products to build an eco-friendly, high-performance distributed system. It utilizes server resources only as needed, allowing for a very environmentally and economically friendly design.

The design and material costs of "predicting access loads in advance (design costs) and increasing server resources (material costs)" are no longer necessary, and concentrating more on things and developing is possible.

Furthermore, maintenance costs are significantly reduced. Post-release apps also automatically scale up computing resources to match user usage patterns. You don't need to worry about credentials, configuration, provisioning new servers, or decommissioning old servers.

Skeet is an open-source, full-stack serverless app development solution that makes Firebase and Google Cloud product combinations easier and easier to use.

Skeet CLI is not only for setting, deploying, and managing Firebase products but also for application development, such as VPN network settings, domain and name server settings, load balancer management security settings using Cloud Armor, and CI & CD using GitHub Actions. We provide that with a single command. Skeet supports everything from backend construction to front-end web, iOS, and Android development.

In addition, for more scalable and robust application development, we adopt tools useful for development, such as TypeScript, Jest, ESLint & Prettier by default. TypeScript is mainly used for ease of application creation, but it is also possible to build applications that partially utilize machine learning using Python.

By using Skeet, you can significantly reduce app development and maintenance costs and realize more plans.
